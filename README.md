Weird Caucus: The Boys are Back In Town
---------------------------------------

Following the embarassing failure of democracy that was the 2020 Iowa
caucuses, @MCMaurer, @SethYefrican and I got to work looking at the
rules for the Nevada caucuses, and it immediately became abundantly
clear that these too will be a disaster. In summary, the Nevada caucuses
will be like the Iowa Caucuses 2: EXTREME MODE, given the rules are
basically the same as Iowa with the additional complication of early
voting providing new and exciting challenges for duly elected caucus
leaders.

Together with our pals @thirdcreed and @erikdstock, we’re proud to
present you [Ugly Caucus](http://www.uglycauc.us), our stab at
providing much needed transparency to the caucus process by
automatically scraping and analyzing reported vote totals for likely
errors and visualizing them to make them understandable for civilians
who haven’t burned holes in their brains meditating on these arcane
rules as we have.

In this repo you’ll find the scripts for pulling and analyzing the
results using R and making heavy use of the Tidyverse. [In this
repo](https://github.com/thirdcreed/Nevada) you can check out the
incredible work @thirdcreed and @erikdstock have done on the UI. Your
questions, comments and suggestions are all appreciated.
